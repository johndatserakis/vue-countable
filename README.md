### Install

```
# npm
npm i vue-countable

# yarn
yarn add vue-countable
```

Or you can include it through the browser at the bottom of your page:

`<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-countable/dist/vue-countable.min.js"></script>`

### About

Simple way to count characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in your Vue apps.

Pass your `text` as a prop to the provided component, along with a unique `elementId`, and register for the `change` event to get real-time count updates.

### Usage Example

```html
import VueCountable from 'vue-countable'
Vue.component('vue-countable', VueCountable)
```

```html
<!-- In your html - Make sure the elementId prop is unique on your page. -->
<vue-countable
    :text="myText" // Your text variable
    :elementId="'myId'" // A unique string id
    @change="change" // Register for the change event
></vue-countable>

<!-- The @change function -->
change (event) {
    console.log(event)
    // event.words to get word count, etc.
}
```

Now, anytime (and on component initialization) your `myText` variable changes, `vue-countable` will emit an event containing the details of your text. Register for this event as shown above to get your real-time counts.

### Props

|---------|-------|--------------------------------|
| text | String | Text you want to track. |
